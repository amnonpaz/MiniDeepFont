MiniDeepFont: Fonts classification CNN, based on DeepFont

When given .h5 file, the scripts create a cached fonts database, ready for training/predication.
The names of these files should be set by the user.

* Training:
In CreateModel.py:
- Line 22: Set the list of training datasets
- Line 23: Set font cache database
- Line 24: Set the validation dataset file names (can be left empty for no validation)
- Line 25: Set the validation results filename
- Line 32: Set the model file name (.h5 suffix will be added)

Execution: python3 CreatModel.py

* Testing:
Execute: 
python3 TestModel.py <model file name> <test set h5 file name> <csv result file name> <intermediate temp file>

- model file name: The model .h5 file
- test set h5 file name: Test set database .h5 file
- csv result file name: Test results file
- intermediate temp file: Fonts cache database

* Required packages:
- matplotlib
- skimage 
- tensorflow
- keras
- h5py
- numpy
- csv
